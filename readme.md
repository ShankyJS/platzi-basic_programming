In JavaScript the random numbers don't works in intervals, it gives us a number about 0.00001 and - 0.9999

[-] Static classes are functions with a lot of operations, for example Math on JS.

[-]``Math.ceil(3.78) == 4 //Aproximate our number``
[-]``Math.floor(3.78) == 3 //Aproximate our number``

And for random numbers is:

[-]``Math.random();``

This gives us a number between 0.000~1 and 0.999~9
