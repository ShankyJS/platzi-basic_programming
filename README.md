## First code line.

In Google Chrome, we can use his developer tools to do awesome things, today I wrote my "first code line" in JavaScript.

First, let's try the command _alert_ 

```
    alert ("Hi, my name is Jhan");
```

Now we can use the _var_ tag to save our name in a variable.

```
var name = "Jhan";
```

Now if we type name on the f12 Console, it's display our name.

```
    alert ("My name is " + name)
```
## Working with numbers

We can save numbers in variables, so we can solve easy math problems.

```
var x = 1;
var y = 3;
x + y 


---> 4
```

We can prompt data too.

```
name = prompt("Write your name");
alert("Your name is " + name); 
```
